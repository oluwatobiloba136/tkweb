These are some of the ways to cook with fire outside. Cooking meat using a spit is a great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from burning, it's best to slowly rotate it.

And yet, he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank. It seemed like it should have been so simple.

It's a \"simpler static site generator\" written in javascript that's intentionally not tied to any particular javascript framework or templating language. At least partially through these attributes it's attracted a minimalist and performance oriented culture, epitomized by the official Eleventy Performance Leaderboard - a global ranking of Lighthouse scores for websites created with Eleventy. My favorite project built with Eleventy that I've found so far is @cramforce's high-performance-blog template.
