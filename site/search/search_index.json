As a data analyst, you are given a list of phone number to find if the customer number match any of them. To your surprise, your ssearch will return no match because you are searching for unknown value. Usually, comparing the data in a column to a value or comparing the values from two columns returns either TRUE or FALSE. If the expression in the WHERE clause evaluates to TRUE, then the row is returned. If the expression evaluates to FALSE, then the row is not returned. If a value in the expression contains NULL, then the expression is resolved to UNKNOWN. In some ways, the behavior is like FALSE. When an expression resolves to UNKNOWN, the row is not returned. The problems begin when using any operator except for equal to (=). The opposite of FALSE is TRUE, but the opposite of UNKNOWN is still UNKNOWN. To test for a NULL, you will want to use the IS [NOT] NULL expression. Additionally, you may want to change a NULL to a value like an empty string ('').

Cooking meat using a spit is a great way to evenly cook meat. In order to keep meat from burning, it's best to slowly rotate it. Hot stones can be used to toast bread. Coals are hot and can bring things to a boil quickly.
